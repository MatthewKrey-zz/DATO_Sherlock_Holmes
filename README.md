# Text Analysis experiment with Dato

Solid Saturday Stat Study with Dato & Python. I recently discovered
Dato after seeing one of their [Events](https://dato.com/events/) posted
on Twitter and have been enjoying learning more about how to use their
platform tools for rapid and powerful Machine Learning prototyping.

This repo reflects my open thoughts following along with one of the lessons
found in the [Dato Gallery](https://dato.com/learn/gallery/).

## Linear Regression

In statistics, linear regression is an approach for modeling the relationship
between a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables
(or independent variables) denoted X.

For example, if we want to predict the number of times the word 'Sherlock'
appears in a text based on the number of times the word 'Watson' appears
in a text.

The case of one explanatory variable is called **simple linear regression.**
