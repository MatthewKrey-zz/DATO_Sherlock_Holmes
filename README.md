## Linear Regression

In statistics, linear regression is an approach for modeling the relationship
between a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables
(or independent variables) denoted X.

For example, if we want to predict the number of times the word 'Sherlock'
appears in a text based on the number of times the word 'Watson' appears
in a text. 

The case of one explanatory variable is called **simple linear regression.**
